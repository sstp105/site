      "description": "During my academic career at BCIT, I built a lot of projects including dynamic web applications and web crawler for data analysis. I started with basic HTML, CSS for static site. Later down the road, I learned JS and SQL and built some interactive web applications such as chat room and twitter clone. Afterwards, I spent most of my time on React philosophy, Design Pattern and Web Performance & Optimization. What I learned is that reading doc or watching video alone will never improve your coding skills, and you will always face new challenges during the development."
